Consider the following paragraph:<br><br>
Researchers in Mumbai have found that certain types<br><br>
of gallstones can be dissolved by injecting them with a gasoline<br><br>
additive in the form of ether. The ether is injected through a tube<br><br>
directly into the gall bladder. The one-day treatment works only on<br><br>
cholesterol-based stones, not those composed largely of calcium.<br><br>
However, as the cholesterol stones are by far the most common type,<br><br>
for millions of gallstone sufferers the treatment should offer a<br><br>
welcome alternative to surgery, the commonest option in most<br><br>
hospitals.<br><br>

# "It takes more than one day for ether to dissolve a calcium-based<br><br>
gallstone".<br><br>

# "Gallstones can only be dissolved by injections".<br><br>

# "Gallstones can quickly be cured with surgery".<br><br>

# "Ether is largely used for dissolving gallstones".<br><br>

# "Calcium stones can be cured in one day".<br><br>

# "Hundreds of people contains calcium stones".<br><br>
